	stock market and foreign exchange (FX) data. It provides various commands 
	to fetch stock prices, currency exchange rates, and other financial data.

	Usage examples:

 	# Get FX rates for a currency pair
  	stockexchange fx --symbol=c:USDEUR

  	# Get stock price for a specific company
  	stockexchange stocks --symbol=AAPL

	This tool integrates with external financial data sources to fetch the latest 
	market prices and exchange rates. Use the appropriate subcommands to get 
	the information you need.`,
